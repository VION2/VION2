- 👋 👋 Hey, I’m @VION2! Welcome to my little world, which is brighter than the sign of the pizza shop and more refreshing than the morning coffee! I'm a code regent, a keyboard fanatic, and a big fan of tea leaves and bugs.

🚀 I am curious about technology, innovation and unsolved mysteries. I'm learning more stuff than I've played with electrical appliances, but please don't tell my electrical appliances, I'm not new to them at all. If you are interested in any novel ideas, projects or memes, please feel free to share them with me!

💬 I believe laughter is the antidote to most problems, so here, in addition to the whims of code, you might find a joke or two. If you are also a master of humor, we will definitely be a perfect match!

📫 How to find me? It's simple, follow the clicking of the keyboard, or look for the source of laughter in the maze of code, and you can find me. If it's an emergency, please put some chocolates on the keyboard and I will definitely reply as soon as possible!

Welcome to my digital world, where I hope you feel happy, inspired, and just a little bit crazy! 🚀✨
- 👀 I am very interested in artificial intelligence and image art.
- 🌱 I am learning how to better apply artificial intelligence to solve any problem in my life and work.
- 💞️ I hope to find efficient tools that can assist in art design, exhibition planning, etc.
